A web component representing a window.

The window is closable, minimisable (although that will just hide it, as no menu for retrieving minimised windows has been implemented) and maximisable. There has been an attempt to implement moving, but it is at the moment very unpredictable, even though the code is based on the author's own code; perhaps it did not work even then.

Some methods are available for a Javascript developer to use, but the developer is invited to listen to the custom events.
